# Playground

Try Formhaus live in the browser. Edit the code to see changes instantly.

## React

<ClientOnly>
  <PlaygroundSection framework="react" />
</ClientOnly>

## Vue

<ClientOnly>
  <PlaygroundSection framework="vue" />
</ClientOnly>

## Svelte

Uses `@formhaus/core` directly with no adapter. You write the rendering.
