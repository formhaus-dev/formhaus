# How do I design a form in Figma and ship the same form in React?

Formhaus keeps the form in one JSON definition. The Formhaus Figma plugin draws that definition as screens with your design system components, a flow map for branching forms and a clickable prototype. Edits made in the plugin are saved back into the same definition, and `FormRenderer` from `@formhaus/react` renders the identical JSON in the app, so the design and the shipped form cannot drift.

## Live preview

<RecipePreview name="account-flow" />

## Definition

<<< @/recipes/definitions/account-flow.json

## 1. Generate the screens in Figma

1. Build and import the plugin from `packages/figma/manifest.json`, as described in the [plugin guide](/guide/figma#install).
2. Run **Plugins > Development > Formhaus**, open **JSON** on the **Form** tab and paste the definition.
3. Pick **Material 3 kit** or **iOS-like kit**, or **My components** to render with your own design system.
4. Click **Generate form**. The plugin creates a frame per step, a flow map with an arrow per route and a prototype.

## 2. Review the flow and the prototype

The flow map lays out `kind`, then `business` and `personal` side by side, both converging at `review`. Each arrow carries its route condition. **Present** opens the prototype at the first step: choosing Business opens Company details, Continue opens Review.

## 3. Edit in Figma and copy the JSON back

Select a generated form and the plugin opens it for editing. Designers change labels, helper text, options, required rules, button labels and field order in **Fields**, then click **Update form** to redraw it in place. **JSON** shows the updated definition. Copy it into the repository, replacing `account-flow.json`.

## 4. Render the same JSON in React

```tsx
import { FormRenderer } from '@formhaus/react';
import { parseDefinition } from '@formhaus/core';
import '@formhaus/core/style.css';
import accountFlow from './account-flow.json';

const definition = parseDefinition(accountFlow);

export function CreateAccount() {
  return (
    <FormRenderer
      definition={definition}
      onSubmit={async (values) => {
        await fetch('/api/accounts', { method: 'POST', body: JSON.stringify(values) });
      }}
    />
  );
}
```

To use the components the designs were drawn with, pass them through the `components` prop. Vue uses the same JSON with `FormRenderer` from `@formhaus/vue`.

## How it works

- Each generated frame stores its definition, so selecting it in Figma reopens the exact JSON the app ships.
- The flow map and prototype come from `routes`. The radio with `autoAdvance` links each option to the step its route picks.
- **Update form** keeps step positions you moved on the canvas, redraws the arrows and rewires the prototype.
- The plugin editor keeps conditions, routes and validation rules it does not show, so a round trip through Figma does not drop logic.
- Run `checkDefinition()` from `@formhaus/core` in CI, or the MCP server's `validate_definition`, on JSON copied from Figma before it ships.
